0.  GIF supports 256 different colours whereas BMP,JPEG support 16M different colours. PNG supports 256T different colours.
1.  GIF supports animation.
2.  Lossless compression allows reconstruction of the original image from the compressed data whereas a lossy image once compressed will lost some of its information hence preventing reconstruction of original image.
3.  JPEG is a lossy-compressed format.
4.  The references to the data on the disk are deleted from the file allocation table.
5.  Overwriting the data on the disk with 0s.
6.  <stdint.h> is a header file having various integer types with certain widths.
7.  These types allows to write implementation- and plattform-independent code.
8.  A BYTE is defined as having 8 bit, DWORD and LONG having 32bit and WORD is defined with 16 bit.
9.  The first 2 bytes must read 0x42 0x4d.
10. bfSize holds the file size of the bitmap, while biSize is defined as the size of the Bitmapinfoheader structure.
11. A negative value for biHeight suggests that the vertical orientation of the image is upside-down.
12. It is defined by : biBitCount.
13. This command returns NULL if the user has no write permission on that file.
14. We want to copy one individual structure per read hence fread will always be 1
15. value of padding will be 3.
16. fseek is used to move the position pointer through a file stream.
17. SEEK_CUR indicates the current position of the position pointer.
18. It looks like Mr. Rob Bowden but I couldn't be sure.
